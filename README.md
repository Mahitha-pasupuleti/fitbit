## Introduction
Welcome to the Fitbit Analysis System README! This system is designed to track user heart rates throughout the day using registered Fitbit devices. It leverages a lakehouse architecture to store and process data efficiently.

## Planning Phase Architecture
The planning phase architecture outlines the system's initial design and considerations for implementing the Fitbit Analysis System.

## Introduction to Data Lakehouse
Learn about the concept of a Data Lakehouse, its key features, and how it combines elements of data lakes and data warehouses.

## Medallion Architecture
Understand the Medallion Architecture used in this system, which organizes data in a lakehouse and progressively improves data quality through different layers.

## Project Architecture
Explore the detailed architecture of the Fitbit Analysis System, including data sources, data flow, processing layers, and analytics components.

## Types of Data
Understand the different types of data handled by the system, such as user profile data, BPM stream data, workout session data, and GYM summaries.

## Kafka
Learn about Kafka integration in the system for real-time data streaming, including producers, consumers, and data ingestion processes.
